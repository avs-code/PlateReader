# PlateReader
Reads car number plates and displays information in Augmented Reality.

## In progress:
Recognise a number plate and not anything else with characters (the AI needs a dataset of at least one type of number plate to recognise the number plate and classify it, segmenting it according to its parts: country code, numbers, letters, spaces).

## Completed:
Character recognition by OCR.
Return information from the database (json).
