# PlateReader
Reads car number plates and displays information in Augmented Reality.

The project began in 2024, but was put on hold due to the need to train an AI or obtain a datasets to distinguish between valid characters on a number plate and characters in other places.

## In progress:
Recognise a number plate and not anything else with characters (the AI needs a dataset of at least one type of number plate to recognise the number plate and classify it, segmenting it according to its parts: country code, numbers, letters, spaces).

## Completed:
Character recognition by OCR.
Return information from the database (json).

## Example
Characters hiden for privacy reasons.
